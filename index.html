            payoff statement or a mortgage payoff letter will typically show the balance a borrower must pay to close their loan. It may also include additional 
            details such as the amount of interest that will be rebated due to prepayment by the borrower.
            Payoff statements provide clear disclosure for a borrower on the total amount they must payoff to close a loan account. They can also include other 
            important loan details such as the remaining payment schedule, rate of interest and money saved for paying early. A borrower can request a payoff 
            statement on any type of loan. (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/payoff-statement.asp) -->

                    <h4>Central Neighbourhood</h4>
                    <p>The city centre of Haarlem is a very pleasant place to spend your time throughout both day and night. Surrounded by “grachten” and featuring
                        the city’s main square; the “Grote Markt”. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Grote_Markt%2C_Haarlem.jpg"
                        alt="Grote Markt and the Grote Kerk"></p>
                    <p>The neighbourhood is Haarlem’s most active, due to it being filled with cultural attractions, <a href="#haarlemCenterRestaurants">restaurants &
                        cafes</a>, <a href="#haarlemCenterGardens">gardens & grachten</a> and numerous <a href="#haarlemCenterShops">shops</a>, both from well-known
                        international retailers as well as local boutiques and craftsmen. If you are visiting Haarlem, it is almost a given that you will visit the
                        centre, with how much you can find here. There is something here for everyone.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="item" id="haarlemCenterRestaurants">
                    <h4>Restaurants &amp; Cafes</h4>
                    <p>Whether it is to meet with friends & family or to take a break from a day of shopping in the centre, the neighbourhood offers a wide range of
                        restaurants and cafes that feature delicious meals and drinks. Some restaurants that are people’s favourites include: Ome Pietje, Sumo and
                        De Frietkamer. For cafes, be sure to check out Big Babette or Meneer Paprika.</p>

                <section class="item" id="haarlemCenterGardens">
                    <h4>Gardens &amp; Grachten</h4>
                    <p>Due to the medieval style of the city, the centre is densely filled with buildings and as such leaves little space for parks. However, the
                        neighbourhood features some very enjoyable gardens, such as the Wijngaard Tuin. As often the case in the densely populated Dutch cities in the
                        “Randstad”, these gardens are often behind building blocks or apartments, so keep an eye out for them. Furthermore, taking a trip around the
                        grachten that enclose the centre is a great short trip. The city centre is often most scenic when viewed from a boat, looking up on the lively
                        streets of Haarlem.</p>

                <section class="item" id="haarlemCenterShops">
                    <h4>Shops</h4>
                    <p>The centre is of great importance to the city due to the number of shops that are found here. You will not have a hard time finding well known
                        international brands such as Adidas or H&M. Thankfully, there are also smaller boutiques such as flower shops or artsy decoration stores. Here
                        you could for example find lovely souvenirs. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Centrum%2C_Haarlem%2C_Netherlands_-_panoramio_%2862%29.jpg"
